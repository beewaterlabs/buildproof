FIGlet

FIGlet is a computer program that generates text banners, in a variety of typefaces, composed of letters made up of conglomerations of smaller ASCII characters.

    sudo apt-get install figlet

You can know the full details and functioning of FIGlet by man command

    man figlet

Syntax for generating banner

figlet -f {fontname} ‚ÄúTEXT FOR BANNER‚Äù

to know the font names available along with how they look, use this command in terminal:

showfigfonts ‚Äî it shows font with default text

showfigfonts ‚ÄúSOME TEXT‚Äù ‚Äî it shows font with custom text

As FIGlet being setup, now lets add some more fonts to our arsenal.

follow these commands:

    cd /usr/share
    sudo git clone https://github.com/xero/figlet-fonts
    sudo mv figlet-fonts/* figlet && sudo rm ‚Äìrf figlet-fonts

Now if you try showfigfonts again, you will see lot more fonts.

LOLCAT

Lolcat provide color for the text we display on terminal.

    git clone https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat
    cd lolcat/bin/ && sudo gem install lolcat

for help with lolcat command, use

    lolcat -h

The Final Steps

    sudo gedit /etc/bash.bashrc

This will open up a text editor with lot of script in it, scroll to the bottom and

add the following:

    clear
    figlet -c -f {font_you_chose} ‚ÄúText_to_be_displayed‚Äù | lolcat

Done! save it and open a new terminal to see the banner there. You can add your own customization.
