 --set  Set  the  Hardware  Clock  to  the  time given by the --date option, and update the
              timestamps in /etc/adjtime.  With the --update-drift option (re)calculate the drift
              factor.

Using the rtc interface to the clock.
Last drift adjustment done at 0 seconds after 1969
Last calibration done at 0 seconds after 1969

Golden Ticket:

sudo timedatectl set-time UTC
sudo hwclock --utc --systohc

The first command sets the system time to UTC time using the timedatectl command. The sudo command is required to run this command with administrative privileges. The set-time option is used to set the system time, and the UTC argument specifies that the system time is in UTC.

The second command sets the hardware clock to UTC time while leaving the system time as local time using the hwclock command. The --utc option specifies that the hardware clock is in UTC, and the --systohc option sets the hardware clock from the system time. This command should be run with administrative privileges using sudo.

By using these two commands, you can set the hardware clock to UTC while leaving the system time as local time.
